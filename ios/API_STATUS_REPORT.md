   - Sign in working
   - Returns user profile and session
   - Saves access token

2. **Health Check** - `/api/mobile/health`
   - Returns status OK

## 🔧 APIs Created/Fixed

   - Created endpoint to fetch user transactions
   - Requires auth token

2. **Reimbursements** - `/api/mobile/reimbursements`
   - Created endpoint to fetch reimbursement requests
   - Requires auth token

3. **Educational Content** - `/api/mobile/education/content`
   - Created endpoint for educational articles
   - Supports filtering by category, featured, search

## ❌ Issues to Fix

1. **Auth Headers** - Need to update all API calls to include auth token
2. **Weekly Tips** - Missing `/api/mobile/education/weekly-tip` endpoint
3. **Transaction Analysis** - The analyze endpoint exists but may need auth
4. **Plaid Integration** - Bank connection endpoints need mobile versions

## 🚀 Next Steps

To make everything work in the iOS app:

1. Sign out and sign back in to get a fresh auth token
2. The app should now be able to:
   - Show your correct name (Samuel Ahuno)
   - Load educational content
   - Access transactions (once connected to bank)
   - View reimbursement requests

## 📝 Testing

Test each screen in the iOS app:
- Dashboard ✅ (should show correct name)
- Learn tab (should load articles)
- Transactions tab (will be empty until bank connected)
- Requests tab (should show any existing requests)
