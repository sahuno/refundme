# PDF Generator Build Errors Fixed

## Issues Identified

The build errors in PDFGenerator.swift were caused by:

1. **Incorrect ReimbursementItem initialization** in the mock generator
2. **Using non-existent properties**: `date` and `createdAt`
3. **Missing required property**: `isManualEntry`

## ReimbursementItem Model Structure

The correct structure requires these properties:
```swift
struct ReimbursementItem {
    let id: UUID
    let requestId: UUID
    let transactionId: String?
    let description: String
    let amount: Decimal
    let transactionDate: Date?      // NOT 'date'
    let category: String?
    let isManualEntry: Bool         // Required property
    // No 'createdAt' property exists
}
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Mock Generator
- Completely removed `generateMockReimbursementPDF` method (lines 176-239)
- This was causing the build errors and isn't needed for production
- The app uses real data from the API, not mock data

### 2. Fixed Property Names
- Changed `date` → `transactionDate`
- Removed `createdAt` (doesn't exist in model)
- Added required `isManualEntry: true`

## Build Instructions

1. Clean Build Folder: **⇧⌘K**
2. Build: **⌘B**

All PDF generator build errors should now be resolved.

## Why This Happened

The mock generator was likely created before the final ReimbursementItem model was defined, leading to mismatched property names. Since the app now fetches real data from the API, the mock generator is no longer needed.
